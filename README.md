This is a discussion-board build in Django, for improving the hands-on efficiency on the same.
This board have multiple boards, which would contain topics, which would further contain posts from the user.
Apart from that, this application also has features like user sign-up, sign-in, password reset option etc.

*This application is in Beta phase, so any suggestion would be much appreciated*
